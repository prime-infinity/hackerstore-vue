An hackerrank Vue.js Challange
A simple hypothetical Store/Shop implementation in vue. Implementation maybe simple, but
encompasses many use cases of a real world Store application.

## Features

- A list of Store items/products with name and price tags are already presented.In a normal application, these items will come from a backend.
- A Cart section is also provided, the cart section will contain all the items added to the cart, as well as their name,quantity and price.
- The cart section also has a coupon select menu, which when selected, will add a discount to the final cart total. 
- Cicking the "Add to cart" button on any item will add the item to the cart, as well as update the cart's total price.
- Clicking on the "remove" button will remove the item from cart and also  update the cart's total price.
